Project Description
General App Idea/Purpose

I am updating a app I first build in the software engineering bootcamp. I am planing to use express.js for the backend with a mongodb database and React.js for the frontend with tailwind.

I'm creating an app that allows users to track jobs applied and update if an interview was granted. I am creating this app because I will be applying to a lot of jobs soon and would like a way to track it.

Models including field names and their datatypes

I'll be creating a jobs model which tracks the job title, location, date applied, and if granted an interview. Job title, location, and date will be a string. Getting an interview will be boolean. I will also use a user model that accepts email and password.

A list of routes (e.g. POST /pins/ allows users to post a picture of a pin)

Index/GET- / - Show all the jobs users applied to
New/GET - /jobs/new - Display form to add a job to the user's list
Create/POST - /jobs - Create new entry and redirects to index
Show/GET - /jobs/:id - Show info about job
Edit/GET - /jobs/:id/edit - Show edit form to adjust job listing
Update/POST - /jobs/:id - Update job listing info and redirect back to show page
Destroy/DELETE - /jobs/:id - Delete a specific job listing and redirect to the index page
